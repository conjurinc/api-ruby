# v4.21.1 (unreleased)

* Add `show_expired` argument to `Conjur::Variable#value` to allow
  retrieval of values of expired variables.
* Fix `Conjur::API#variable_expirations` so it returns an array of
  `Conjur::Variable`, rather than a `Hash`.

# v4.21.0

* Add extensible Bootstrap commands as API methods.
* `bootstrap` grants `reveal` and `elevate` to the `security_admin` group.
* `bootstrap` creates `webservice:authn-tv`.
* `bootstrap` creates an `auditors` group and gives `reveal` privilege to it.

# v4.20.0

* Add support for Host Factory functionality (replaces conjur-asset-host-factory plugin).

* Add `Conjur::API` methods to querying service versions : `service_version`, `service_names`, `appliance_info`.

* Support ISO8601 duration strings as arguments in variable expiration methods.
* Add support for CIDR restrictions

# v4.19.1

* BUGFIX: Allow Configuration to parse several certs in a string

     to the default cert store.
