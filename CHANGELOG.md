The following enhancements require Conjur server 4.9.1.0 or later:

* Supports filter and pagination of role-listing methods.

* Supports the +role+ field on `Conjur::RoleGrant`.

On older server versions, the new options will be ignored by the server.

# v4.29.2

* `Conjur::API#resources` now supports `:owner` to retrieve all resources owned (directly or indirectly) by the indicated role. This capability has always been provided by the service, but was not exposed by the Ruby API.

# v4.29.1

* `Conjur::API#audit` now supports `:has_annotation` to retrieve audit events for resources annotated with the given name.

# v4.29.0

* Add `Conjur::API#new_from_token_file` to create an API instance from a file which contains an access token, which should be periodically updated by another process.

# v4.28.2

* Make sure certificate file is readable before trying to use it.

# v4.28.1

* `Conjur::API#ldap_sync_policy` now returns log events generated when
  showing a policy.

# v4.28.0

* Add `Conjur::API#ldap_sync_policy` to fetch the policy to use to
  bring Conjur and the LDAP server into sync.

* Remove `Conjur::API#ldap_sync_now` and `Conjur::API#ldap_sync_jobs`

# v4.27.0

* Add `Conjur::API#resources_permitted?"

* `Conjur::API#ldap_sync_now` now accepts an options Hash which will
  be passed on to the `/sync` entrypoint. The old argument list is
  maintained for backwards compatibility.

* `Conjur::Api#resources` now supports `:has_annotation` for
  retrieving Conjur resources that have an annotation with the given
  name.

# v4.26.0

* expose admin_option in the role graph (only populated by Conjur 4.8 and later)

# v4.25.1

* Fix token refresh when using `with_privilege`, `with_audit_roles`,
  and `with_audit_resources`.

# v4.25.0

* Add a workaround for a bug in Conjur <4.7 where long-running operations
  (such as policy load) would sometimes fail with 404 after five minutes.

# v4.24.1

* Clarify the handling of the dry-run argument to `Conjur::API#ldap_sync_now`.

# v4.24.0

* Add `Conjur::API#ldap_sync_now` (requires Conjur 4.7 or later).
* Don't trust the system clock and don't check token validity. Rely on the
  server to verify the token instead, and only try to refresh if enough time
  has passed locally (using monotonic clock for reference where available).
* Don't try refreshing the token if the required credentials are not available.

# v4.23.0

* Add `with_audit_roles` and `with_audit_resources` to `Conjur::API`
  to add additional roles and resources to audit records generated by
  requests

  retrieval of values of expired variables.
* Properly assign ownership of bootstrap-created webservice resources to the `security_admin` group.

# v4.21.0

* Add extensible Bootstrap commands as API methods.
* `bootstrap` grants `reveal` and `elevate` to the `security_admin` group.
* `bootstrap` creates `webservice:authn-tv`.
* `bootstrap` creates an `auditors` group and gives `reveal` privilege to it.

# v4.20.1

* BUGFIX: Better handling for unicode and special characters in user ids.

# v4.20.0

* Add support for Host Factory functionality (replaces conjur-asset-host-factory plugin).

* Add support for CIDR restrictions

# v4.19.1

* BUGFIX: Allow Configuration to parse several certs in a string
