module Conjur
  # A {http://developer.conjur.net/reference/services/authorization/role Conjur Role} represents an actor that
  # can be granted or denied permissionto do various things to
  # {http://developer.conjur.net/reference/services/authorization/resource Conjur Resources}.  Roles are hierarchical:
  # if role a is a **member of** role b, a is permitted to do everything b is permitted
  # to do.  This relationship is transitive, so if a is a member of b, b is a member of c,
  # and c is a member of d, a has all of d's permissions.
  #
  # This class represents a Role with a particular identifier.  The actual Conjur role *may or may not
  # exist!*
  class Role < RestClient::Resource
    include Exists
    include PathBased
    include QueryString

    # The *unqualified* identifier for this role.

    # so if `a` is a member of `b`, and `b` is a member of `c`, `a.all` will include `c`.
    #
    # ### Permissions
    # You must be a member of the role to call this method.
    #
    # You can restrict the roles returned to one or more role ids.  This feature is mainly useful
    # for checking whether this role is a member of any of a set of roles.
    #
    # ### Options
    #
    # * **recursive** Defaults to +true+, performs recursive expansion of the memberships.
    #
    # @example Show all roles of which `"conjur:group:pubkeys-1.0/key-managers"` is a member
    #   # Add alice to the group, so we see something interesting

    #   # => ["conjur:group:pubkeys-1.0/admin", "conjur:user:alice"]

    # ### Permissions
    # You must be logged in as a member of this role in order to call this method.  Note that if you
    # pass a role of which you aren't a member to this method, it will return false rather than raising an
    # exception.

    # Grant this role to another one.  The role given by the `member` argument will become
    # a member of this role, and have all of its permissions.
    #
    # ### Permissions
    # You must have admin permissions on this role.
    #
    # @example Allow `'alice'` to do everything that `'bob'` can do (perhaps better!).
    #   bob = api.role 'cook:bob'
    #   alice = api.role 'cook:alice'
    #
    #   # bob is allowed to 'fry' a resource called 'food:bacon'

    #
    #   # alice isn't
    #   alice.permitted? "food:bacon", "fry" # => false
    #
    #   # grant the role 'cook:bob'  to alice, so that she can participate in our culture's
    #   # bizarre bacon obsession!
    #   bob.grant_to alice
    #
    #   # Now she can fry some bacon!
    #   alice.permitted? 'food:bacon', 'fry' # => true
    #
    # @example Make `alice` a member of `job:cook`, and let her grant that role to others
    #   # Create an api logged in as 'alice'.  We assume that `api` is an admin.
    #   alice_api = Conjur::API.new_from_key 'alice', 'alice-password'
    #
    #   # First do it without the `admin_option`
    #   api.role('job:cook').grant_to alice_api.current_role
    #
    #   # Alice can't grant the role to bob
    #   alice_api.role('job:cook').grant_to 'user:bob' # => raises RestClient::Forbidden
    #
    #   # Make alice an admin of the role
    #   api.role('job:cook').grant_to alice_api.current_role, admin_option: true
    #
    #   # Now she can grant the role to bob
    #   alice_api.role('job:cook').grant_to 'user:bob' # Works!
    #
    # @example Take away a member's admin privilege
    #   # alice_api is an api logged in as user "alice", who has admin rights on the role 'job:cooks'.
    #   # Notice that she can grant the role to 'eve'
    #   alice_api.role('job:cook').grant_to 'eve'
    #
    #   # We don't want her to do this any more
    #   admin_api.role('job:cook').grant_to 'user:alice', admin_option: false
    #
    #   # She's still a member
    #   alice_api.member_of?('job:cook') # => true
    #
    #   # But she can't grant the role to 'bob'
    #   alice_api.role('job:cook').grant_to 'user:bob' # raises RestClient:Forbidden
    #
    # @param [String, #roleid] member the role that will become a member of this role
    # @param [Hash] options options for the grant
    # @option options [Boolean] :admin_option when given, the admin flag on the role grant will be set to

    # ### Permissions
    # You must have admin permissions on this role
    #
    #
    # @example Bob has been fired from his job as a cook.

    #   bob = api.role('user:bob')
    #   bob.member_of? 'job:cook' # true
    #   bob.permitted? 'food:bacon', 'fry' # true

    #   api.role('user:alice').member_of? 'user:bob' # true
    #   api.role('user:alice').permitted? 'food:bacon', 'fry' # => false

    # Check to see if this role is allowed to perform `privilege` on `resource`.
    #
    # ### Permissions
    # Any authenticated role may call this method.  However, instead of raising a 404 if a resource
    # or role doesn't exist, it will return false.  This is to prevent bad guys from finding out which roles
    # and resources exist.
    #
    # @example
    #   bacon = api.create_resource 'food:bacon'
    #   eggs  = api.create_resoure 'food:eggs'
    #   bob = api.create_role 'cook:bob'
    #
    #   # Bob can't do anything initially
    #   bob.permitted? bacon, 'fry' # => false
    #   bob.permitted? eggs, 'poach' # => false
    #
    #   # Let him poach eggs
    #   eggs.permit 'poach', bob
    #
    #   # Now it's permitted
    #   bob.permitted? eggs, 'poach' # => true
    #
    # @example Somethign a bit more realistic
    #   # Say we have a service layer that needs access to a database connection string.
    #   # The layer is called 'web', and the connection string is stored in a variable 'mysql-uri'
    #   web_layer = api.layer 'web'
    #   mysql_uri = api.variable 'mysql-uri'

    #
    #   # Let's permit that
    #   mysql_uri.permit 'execute', web_layer
    #
    #   # Now it's allowed to fetch the connection string
