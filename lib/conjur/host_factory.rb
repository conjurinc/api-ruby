  # any other access to Conjur.

  # Each Host Factory can have 0 or more tokens, each of which is a random string that
  # has an associated expiration and optional CIDR restriction. A user or machine who has
  # a host factory token can use it to create new hosts, or to rotate the API keys of 
  # existing hosts.
