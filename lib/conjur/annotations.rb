  # Conjur allows {http://developer.conjur.net/reference/services/authorization/resource Resource}
  #   instances to be {http://developer.conjur.net/reference/services/authorization/resource/annotate.html annotated}
  #   with arbitrary key-value data.  This data is generally for "user consumption", and it *is not* governed
  #   by any particular schema or constraints.  Your applications can define their own schema for annotations they
  #   use.  If you do so, we recommend prefixing your annotations, for example, `'myapp:Name'`, in order to avoid
  #   conflict with annotations used, for example, by the Conjur  UI.
  #
  # An Annotations instance acts like a Hash: you can fetch an annotation with {#[]}.
