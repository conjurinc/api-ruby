      #@!group Authentication Methods

      # The Conjur {http://developer.conjur.net/reference/services/authentication/login.html login}
      #   operation exchanges a username and a password for an api key.  The api key
      #   is preferable for storage and use in code, as it can be rotated and has far greater entropy than
      #   a user memorizable password.
      #
      #  * Note that this method works only for {http://developer.conjur.net/reference/services/directory/user Users}. While
      #   {http://developer.conjur.net/reference/services/directory/hosts Hosts} possess Conjur identities, they do not
      #   have passwords.
      #  * If you pass an api key to this method instead of a password, it will simply return the API key.
      #  * This method uses Basic Auth to send the credentials.
      #
      # @example
      #   bob_api_key = Conjur::API.login('bob', 'bob_password')
      #   bob_api_key == Conjur::API.login('bob', bob_api_key)  # => true
      #
      # @param [String] username The `username` or `login` for the
      #   {http://developer.conjur.net/reference/services/directory/user Conjur User}.
      # @param [String] password The `password` or `api key` to authenticate with.
      # @return [String] the API key.
      # @raise [RestClient::Exception] when the request fails or the identity provided is invalid.
