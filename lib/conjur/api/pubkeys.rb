      # @!group Public Keys Service

      # Fetch *all*  public keys for the user.  This method returns a newline delimited
      # String for compatibility with the authorized_keys SSH format.
      #
      #
      # If the given user does not exist, an empty String will be returned.  This is to prevent attackers from determining whether
      # a user exists.
      #
      # ## Permissions
      # You do not need any special permissions to call this method, since public keys are, well, public.
      #
      #
      # @example
      #   puts api.public_keys('jon')
      #   # ssh-rsa [big long string] jon@albert
      #   # ssh-rsa [big long string] jon@conjurops
      #
      # @param [String] username the *unqualified* Conjur username
      # @return [String] newline delimited public keys
      def public_keys account, username
        public_keys_resource(account, username).get
