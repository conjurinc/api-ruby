    # Return a {Conjur::Role} representing a role with the given id.  Note that the {Conjur::Role} may or
    # may not exist (see {Conjur::Exists#exists?}).
    #
    # ### Permissions
    #
    # Because this method returns roles that may or may not exist, it doesn't require any permissions to call it:
    # in fact, it does not perform an HTTP request (except for authentication if necessary).
    #
    # @example Create and show a role
    #   iggy = api.role 'cat:iggy'
    #   iggy.exists? # true
    #   iggy.members.map(&:member).map(&:roleid) # => ['conjur:user:admin']
    #   api.current_role.roleid # => 'conjur:user:admin' # creator role is a member of created role.
    #
    # @example No permissions are required to call this method
    #   api.current_role # => "user:no-access"
    #
    #   # current role is only a member of itself, so it can't see other roles.
    #   api.current_role.memberships.count # => 1
    #   admin = api.role 'user:admin' # OK
    #   admin.exists? # => true
    #   admin.members # => RestClient::Forbidden: 403 Forbidden
    #
    # @param id [String] a fully qualified role identifier
    # @return [Conjur::Role] an object representing the role
    def role id
      build_object id, default_class: Role
    end

    # Return a {Conjur::Role} object representing the role (typically a user or host) that this api is authenticated
    # as.  This is derived either from the `login` argument to {Conjur::API.new_from_key} or from the contents of the
    # `token` given to {Conjur::API.new_from_token}.
    #
    # @example Current role for a user
    #   api = Conjur::API.new_from_key 'jon', 'somepassword'
    #   api.current_role.roleid # => 'conjur:user:jon'
    #
    # @example Current role for a host
    #   host = api.create_host id: 'exapmle-host'
    #
    #   # Host and User have an `api` method that returns an api with their credentials.  Note
    #   # that this only works with a newly created host or user, which has an `api_key` attribute.
    #   host.api.current_role.roleid # => 'conjur:host:example-host'
    #
    # @param [String] account the organization account 
    # @return [Conjur::Role] the authenticated role for this API instance
