    # Fetch the values of a list of variables.  This operation is more efficient than fetching the
    # values one by one.
    #
    # This method will fail unless:
    #   * All of the variables exist
    #   * You have permission to `'execute'` all of the variables
    #
    # @example Fetch multiple variable values
    #   values = variable_values ['myorg:variable:postgres_uri', 'myorg:variable:aws_secret_access_key', 'myorg:variable:aws_access_key_id']
    #   values # =>

    #      "the-secret-key",
    #      "the-access-key-id"
    #   }
    # 
    # This method is used to implement the {http://developer.conjur.net/reference/tools/utilities/conjurenv `conjur env`}
    # commands.  You may consider using that instead to run your program in an environment with the necessary secrets.
